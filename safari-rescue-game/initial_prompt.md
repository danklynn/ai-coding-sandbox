Help me write a spec for an in-browser platform game. The game mechanics should be similar to super Mario brothers. The main character should be a zookeeper/ safari guide whose mission is to save endangered animals from poachers.

The main character primarily defeats low level enemies by jumping on them. Along the way, the main character can collect food, similar to how Mario collects coins. At the end of each level, the player has to defeat a boss poacher who then frees a caged animal.

The spec should focus on getting the first level looking good and playing well before building new levels.
